# RealEstateProject (Beta, unstable)
An python app that reads an Excel file with Real Estate addresses and autopopulates the price columns by querying sites such as Zillow and Trulia. As of now, a lot of the behavior is hard-coded; working on generalizing the behavior for future releases. Working on a site to host
the application for ease of client calling.
