# RealEstateProject

## Public Facing Site: https://www.notereview.org/

End Goal: A Web Application to track market performance of Real Estate properties through uploading loan notes in the form of Excel sheets. Queries APIs such as Zillow and Trulia through a Python script to receive real time data. Uses Firebase for backend support through creating a full User Account System, User Storage, and Metadata Archive Database. Amazon S3 hosts the static web documents as a fail-over. An Amazon EC2 instance running Tomcat will host the app.
